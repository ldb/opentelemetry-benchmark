# This plan runs a 20 minute benchmark, scaling by 5 workers every second. It can be used to establish a baseline
# measurement and to find a limit. It's supposed to showcase a "mutating" workload. It is based on a "realistic" workload
# with a trace depth of 20 levels and 50 spans that carry up to 10 extra attributes.
# Characteristics:
# 4700 Workers ~= 90% CPU load and 82% memory usage
# 5000 Workers ~= 92% CPU load and 88% memory usage
# 5400 Workers ~= 94% CPU load and 93% memory usage
# 5700 Workers ~= 96% CPU load and 98% memory usage
# 5900 Workers ~= 96% CPU load and 100% memory usage # Errors appear, collector was likely OOM killed and restarted
