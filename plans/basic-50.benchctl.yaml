# A highly concurrent benchmark. 5 workers are being created every second for 10 minutes, sending up to a 100 spans at a depth of 10.
# This benchmark should put the collector at the maximum sustainable load.
# Characteristics:
# 1800 Workers ~= 85% CPU load and 30% memory usage
# 2200 Workers ~= 90% CPU load and 40% memory usage
# 3000 Workers ~= 96% CPU load and 55% memory usage
