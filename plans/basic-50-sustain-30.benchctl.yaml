# This benchmark is based on the `basic-50` plan, but different in that it immediatly scales to 2000 workers and without scaling further.
# It takes 30 minutes to complete. This uses benchd's step mode to sustain a load statically.
# Running this benchmark should keep the collector running at a constant 90% CPU utilization and about 40% memory usage.

# bench-50 description:
# A highly concurrent benchmark. 5 workers are being created every second for 10 minutes, sending up to a 100 spans at a depth of 10.
# This benchmark should put the collector at the maximum sustainable load.
# Characteristics:
# 1800 Workers ~= 85% CPU load and 30% memory usage
# 2200 Workers ~= 90% CPU load and 40% memory usage
# 3000 Workers ~= 96% CPU load and 55% memory usage
