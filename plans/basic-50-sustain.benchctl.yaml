# This benchmark is based on the `basic-50` plan, but different in that it immediatly scales to 5000 workers and without scaling further.
# It takes 30 minutes to complete. This uses benchd's step mode to sustain a load statically.
# Running this benchmark should keep the collector running at a constant 90% CPU utilization and about 40% memory usage.
