# This plan runs a 20 minute benchmark. It is based on the realistic-50. The only difference is the worker creation rate, which is 10/s instead of 5/s and a lower receiveTimeout. 
# It is to be used with the sample configuration.
# Characteristics:
# 5000 Workers ~= 50% CPU load and 80% memory usage
# 6000 Workers ~= 55% CPU load and 95% memory usage
# 6600 Workers ~= 58% CPU load and 99% memory usage # Shortly after this, collector OOMs
