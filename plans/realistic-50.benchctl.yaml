# This plan runs a 20 minute benchmark, scaling by 5 workers every second. It can be used to establish a baseline
# measurement and to find limit. Its supposed to showcase a "realistic" workload scenario with a trace depth of 20
# spans that carry up to 10 extra attributes.
# It is similar to the basic-50 plan, but more ... realistic :)
# Characteristics:
# 2300 Workers ~= 50% CPU load and 40% memory usage
# 3000 Workers ~= 76% CPU load and 50% memory usage # End of the 10 minute run
# 3500 Workers ~= 82% CPU load and 62% memory usage # Extended run to 20 minutes
# 4300 Workers ~= 90% CPU load and 76% memory usage # Extended run to 20 minutes
# 5700 Workers ~= 93% CPU load and 98% memory usage # Extended run to 20 minutes
# 5900 Workers ~= 93% CPU load and 100% memory usage # Extended run to 20 minutes; errors appear, collector was likely OOM killed and restarted
